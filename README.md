### CoreML is Awesome \o/

This is a simple Demo App to learn the CoreML API.
This app make digits predictions based on a model trained with the MNIST Dataset of handwritten digits. 
It just draw the digit the CoreML will make a prediction.

### The Model
The model was created and trained using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and Converted to a CoreML model using 
[tf-coreml](https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml). 
The network code, the conversion code and the models generated are available on [LucianoPAlmeida/mnist-number-classification](https://github.com/LucianoPAlmeida/mnist-number-classification).

### Credits and Thanks

- [Brian Advent](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCysEngjfeIYapEER9K8aikw) for the awesome [Core ML Tutorial: Create a Simple Machine Learning App - Image Classification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNKPbdT9gXU) video.
- [CoreML Tools](https://github.com/apple/coremltools) and [tf-coreml](https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml) to make possible the conversion of my tensorflow model to a CoreML model.
